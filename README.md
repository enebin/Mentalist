```

## Features

**Mentalist** is a Swift-based library designed for analyzing and identifying emotions within a picture.

### 1. Seven Emotion Categories

Mentalist classifies the emotions on faces in a photo into **one of seven categories**. Internally, it utilizes a CoreML model based on FER2013 to analyze emotions displayed in a picture into seven categories: 'happy', 'angry', 'disgust', 'fear', 'sad', 'surprise', and 'neutral'.

### 2. Optimized for Mobile Environment

Mentalist has an optimal size for mobile environments. It also takes approximately **0.06 seconds per analysis** with an **accuracy rate of about 57%**.

### 3. Supports Multi-Face Analysis

Mentalist can detect multiple faces. If multiple faces are detected, it returns a list of multiple analysis results.
